How to make:
   	1. Open Addressing hash function
		make hash 
		./hash 200
		(it will create a hash table that has 200 entries)
	2. Chaining hash function
		make chain
		./chain 200
		(it will create a hash table that has 200 entries)
	3. Prim
		The solution to dense_100000.txt is solution_dense
		The solution to sparse_100000.txt is solution_sparse
		
		The output of Prim's algorithm is linked list of edges and weights
		(v, parent, weight)
		v and parent are connected eges
		total weight (sparse) is 32881.378906
		total weight (dense) is 12011.201172
